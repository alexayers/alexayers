### Hey 👋🏻 😎

My name is Alex Ayers, by day I'm the technical product manager overseeing the development and vision for a Digital Health Cloud, but by night I open my IDE and start personal project that I never seem to be able to finish. 

My goal for 2022 is to simple: 

- Create a game in any state that could even remotely consider "playable." 
- It doesn't have to be good. 
- It doesn't have to be fun. 


I'm setting the bar very low this new year. :-DDD
