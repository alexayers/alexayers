### Hey 👋🏻 😎

My name is Alex Ayers, by day I'm the associate director of engineering overseeing the development and vision for a Digital Health Cloud, but by night I open my IDE and start personal projects that I never seem to be able to finish. These days my personal project is a mixed UI / ray casting game that I think has some real promise, but it's early days so far.

Technical Areas of Interest Include 

- ECS design pattern
- TypeScript
- AWS Serverless
- 2D game design
